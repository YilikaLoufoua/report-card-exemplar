# Report Card Exemplar Project
Exemplar code for report card generator with focus on JavaScript & DOM Manipulation

Your college has realized their report card generating system is broken! They've reached out to Site to see if interns would be willing to help them fix it.

At the moment they have the styling and general layout fixed, but they're missing valid JavaScript. Your job is to modify the script.js file with code that produces a working report card generator. They've sent over your grades for the year to use as a model.
